# 3D Mindmap Application

A simple 3D mindmap tool built using React, React Three Fiber, and Three.js, designed for visualizing nodes and edges in a 3D space with interactive features. This project provides a basic structure to build upon and enhance into a more sophisticated 3D data visualization tool.

## Features

- Interactive 3D nodes and edges rendered with Three.js.
- Camera controls for rotating, zooming, and panning the 3D scene.
- Basic node labeling with customizable text.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) - A React renderer for Three.js.
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - A JavaScript 3D library.
- [React Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) - A collection of useful helpers for React Three Fiber.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lifee77/mindmaps_3d.git
   cd mindmaps_3d
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Project Structure

```

- `App.js`: Contains the main 3D mindmap components and rendering logic.
- `index.js`: The entry point for the React application.
- `index.css`: Basic styling for the app.

## How to Use

1. **Nodes**: Nodes are represented as spheres with text labels.
2. **Edges**: Edges are simple lines connecting nodes.
3. **Controls**: Use your mouse to rotate, zoom, and pan around the scene using the built-in `OrbitControls`.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for extending the functionality of the 3D Mindmap Application:

- Add support for dynamic node creation and deletion.
- Implement node/edge interaction (e.g., clicking to display more information).
- Save and load mindmap data using a backend service.
- Incorporate animations for smoother transitions.
- Add VR capabilities using libraries like `react-xr`.
